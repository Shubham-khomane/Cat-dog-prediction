Cat and Dog Image Classifier with Flask
Overview
This project is a simple web application that employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The Flask web framework is utilized to create a user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions from the trained model.

Key Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images in common formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG) via an intuitive web interface.

Real-time Prediction: The uploaded image is processed by a pre-trained VGG16 CNN model to predict whether it contains a cat or a dog. The prediction is displayed on the web page.

Image Preview: Before making a prediction, users can preview the uploaded image on the web page, enhancing the user experience.

Flask Web Framework: The backend is powered by Flask, providing a lightweight and efficient Python web framework.

Responsive Design: The web interface is designed to be visually appealing and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices.

Usage
Upload Image: Navigate to the web page and use the provided form to upload an image file.

View Prediction: The system processes the uploaded image and displays a prediction indicating whether the image contains a cat or a dog.

Image Preview: Users can preview the uploaded image alongside the prediction for verification.

Dependencies
Python
Flask
OpenCV
TensorFlow (Keras)
How to Run
Ensure that the required dependencies are installed using pip install flask opencv-python tensorflow.

Run the app.py script, which starts the Flask development server.

Access the web application by visiting http://localhost:5000 in a web browser.
